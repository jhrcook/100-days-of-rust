# 100 Days of Rust

My journey of learning the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language by working at it for 100 consecutive days.

![pre-commit](https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-FAB040?&logo=precommit&logoColor=FAB040&url=https://www.rust-lang.org/)

To begin, I will be working through [*The Rust Programming Language* (2nd ed.)](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-2nd-dp-1718503105/dp/1718503105/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) by Klabnik and Nichols.

Other possible resources:

- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
- [Command Line Applications in Rust](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html)
- [Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/)

To play with:

- [Rapier](https://rapier.rs/) physics engine
- [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine
- [ndarray](https://docs.rs/ndarray/latest/ndarray/#)
- web scraping

|   3 | Learned about 'loop' and 'match' keywords; read about basics of variables and functions |
|   4 | Finished up control flow syntax and began learning about ownership |
|   5 | Finshed chapter 4 on ownership |
|   6 | Started learning about structs |
|   7 | Finished up the basics of structs and now moving on to enums |
